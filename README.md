   <h3>Debut Episode :</h3><h4> Naruto Shippuden Episode 458</h4>
    
    Kaguya Otsusuki was revealed to be the final boss of the Naruto series in a somewhat questionable manner.<br> However, Kaguya was still a worthy villain and eventually set up the future of the series as well by showcasing the power of the Otsusuki clan.<br> Though her own story was no less tragic, the tragedies that she unleashed upon the world were truly unforgivable.<br>
In an effort to prepare against more invading Otsusukis, Kaguya created an army of zombified Zetsus by killing people.<br> Upon her release from her seal, she presented herself as an unstoppable threat with her dimension-shifting powers and immense strength.<br> Kaguya's attacks also killed Obito Uchiha, who sacrificed himself in a bid to save Naruto.<br><br>

<h3>Debut Episode :</h3><h4>Naruto Shippuden Episode 130</h4>
Madara Uchiha's name alone is enough to send chills down the spine of any shinobi.<br> After facing many wars and losing several loved ones, Madara was convinced that the shinobi world would never know peace, and thus set out to create a new world filled with eternal bliss.<br> Madara not only served as an enemy to the first Hokage, but he also made sure to come up with a plan that would allow him to haunt many future generations of the shinobi.<br>

Using Obito to do most of his bidding, Madara was able to reanimate himself and then proceeded to shift the tide of the Fourth Shinobi World War. <br>He easily dealt with the Five Kage at the time. Even Might Guy's Eighth Inner Gate form and Naruto and Sasuke's newly obtained power boosts were unable to defeat this menace.<br> Eventually, the powerful shinobi was betrayed by Black Zetsu.<br><br><br>

<h3>Debut Episode :</h3><h4>Naruto Shippuden Episode 32</h4>
Obito was a sweet and normal boy who just wanted to impress the love of his life.<br> However, Obito's childhood was cut short when he got crushed by a boulder during a mission.<br> It was later revealed that Obito was saved by none other than Madara Uchiha who went on to manipulate him into doing his bidding.<br> After witnessing the death of Rin, Obito became enraged and felt betrayed by the world.<br><br>



<p><img src="download (5).jpg" width="400"></p>Kabuto<br><br><br><video controls src="video(5).mp4" width="300"></video><h3>Debut Episode :</h3><h4>Naruto Episode 23</h4>

Kabuto was an orphan turned rogue ninja, who ended up under the wing of Orochimaru.<br> From spying and infiltrating to killing ninjas, this character truly did it all. Kabuto even took advantage of Tsunade's trauma of blood to paralyze her.<br> He learned everything from Orochimaru and eventually surpassed his master in spreading chaos in the shinobi world.<br>

Kabuto was also a key instigator of the Fourth Shinobi World War and <br>used the forbidden Reanimation Jutsu to bring back the dead. He was eventually made to reflect on his<br> ways by Itachi's unparalleled Genjutsu after which the mad genius changed sides.<br><br>

<h3>Debut Episode : </h3><h4>Naruto Episode 27</h4>
The big bad of the original series, Orochimaru is truly one of the best and the most terrifying villains of the Naruto franchise.<br> He attacked the leaf, killed the third Hokage, reanimated the first two Hokage,<br> betrayed his friends, abducted and experimented on Leaf ninja, and cursed Sasuke's body with a terrifying seal.<br> Orochimaru's atrocities knew no bounds as he cared for no one but himself.<br>

Orochimaru even planned on taking over Sasuke's body which he eventually failed at, thanks to Itachi's efforts.<br> The Allied Shinobi Forces were lucky that Orochimaru had a change of heart during the Fourth World War,<br> or else they would not have lasted for as long as they did against Madara Uchiha.<br>
